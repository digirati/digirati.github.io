## Who we are

Digirati are a digital consultancy that design and build innovative digital products and services for the public and private sectors. We have a strong reputation as a ‘good player’ in the areas we work in. Our progressive approach of open innovation works through deep engagement with existing ecosystems of technologies, communities and practices. We always make a positive contribution to advance and maintain them whenever we get the opportunity, and help the customer develop their own internal ecosystems of skills and knowledge so that together the solutions we deliver can be sustained for long term success.

Digirati were founded in 2002 by Content Management experts focusing on delivering digital platforms for academic and professional publishing, government agencies and some large corporations. There have been many changes since 2002 in terms of the digital landscape and how we have evolved our practice. We have become experts at appraising new industry trends and best practices to filter what is useful for our customers, and balance that with what is pragmatic for their short and longer term goals.

As part of the latest evolution of our company we have been collaborating closely with cultural heritage, scientific, academic and professional researchers and publishers to bring engineering and product design innovations. Including taking advantage of new cloud and semantic technologies. These innovations bring much improved preservation, management, publishing and discovery of digital content and data. We can see many new applications of these developments across a number of sectors and use cases which we will now look to explore.
